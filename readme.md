App support for Mysterium Escape Room

This is meant to accompany the printed cards and physical items for the 2019 Mysterium Escape Room. To begin, open mysteriumescaperoom.html from a browser (Chrome, Firefox, and Edge are supported), and follow the instructions on the page.
Your progress will be stored locally. If you accidentally close the browser or tab, return to the page and click OK when asked if you wish to resume your previous session.

The app itself is contained in mysteriumescaperoom.js. This handles the mechanics for entering puzzle guesses, stores player progress, and tells players which cards and items to take and/or discard.
